# Configure a dashboard

## Select a layout

Set **Dashboard ID** in the widget settings to the layout's filename without
`.yaml`. Use `default` for the bundled aircraft dashboard.

Layouts are stored in `/WIDGETS/AeroGrid/layouts/`. AeroGrid looks for these
files in order:

1. `<model-identifier>--<dashboard-id>.yaml` for a model-specific layout.
2. `<dashboard-id>.yaml` for a layout shared across models.
3. `default.yaml` if neither file exists.

Use a different Dashboard ID on each EdgeTX screen to select different layouts.
Edit layout files on your computer, then copy them to the SD card.

Before using the bundled layout, adjust its source names, battery cell count,
and alarm thresholds for your model. Its battery source must measure the
flight pack, not a regulated receiver supply.

The bundled dashboard includes a [flight-counter](../panels/flight-counter.md)
tracker using GV9 FM0, `armSwitch: "SFv"` for armed, and CH3 for motor output.
Adjust the panel's `armSwitch` and `motorSource` to match your model;
the separate Mode text panel also needs matching switch mappings. Reserve GV9
with precision 0 and limits allowing `0..999`. The tracker uses 30-second
qualification, a 10-second disarm timeout, and CSV history by default.
Use only one tracking panel across all dashboards and do not run EdgeTX Flights
alongside it. When copying the default layout for a second dashboard, remove the
tracker or replace it with a read-only `metric` using `gvar9`.

## Create a layout

Copy `default.yaml` to a new filename and edit it, or start with this example.
This minimal layout displays EdgeTX timer 1:

```yaml
version: 1
grid:
  columns: 4
  rows: 4
panels:
  - id: flight-clock
    type: flight-timer
    col: 0
    row: 0
    colSpan: 2
    rowSpan: 1
    config:
      timer: 0
      accent: green
```

Save it as `/WIDGETS/AeroGrid/layouts/my-dashboard.yaml` and select
`my-dashboard` as Dashboard ID.

Positions are zero-based: `col: 0`, `row: 0` is the top-left cell. Spans specify
how many cells a panel occupies. Keep placements within the 4 x 4 grid without
overlap, use unique panel IDs, and choose spans supported by the panel.
The `type` selects the panel; `config` contains its settings.

See the [Panel reference](../reference-guide/index.md) for settings and examples.
Use exact, case-sensitive source names from your model's telemetry configuration.
Follow the YAML structure above and the panel examples.

## App mode and Full screen

Choose the screen layout in EdgeTX's **Model Setup → Screens**, then assign
AeroGrid to its widget area.

| Layout | What you see |
| --- | --- |
| **App mode** | A dashboard covering the display, without the EdgeTX top bar, flight-mode label, sliders, or trims. The menu button remains in the top-left corner. |
| **Full screen (`1 x 1`)** | One dashboard widget, with the option to keep EdgeTX's top bar, flight-mode label, sliders, and trims. |

Use App mode for a clean dashboard, or Full screen to keep the radio's
standard information alongside it. In App mode, a wider top-left panel
leaves more room beside the menu button.

## Theming

Choose **Theme** in the widget settings. A layout's optional `theme` block
overrides that selection.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `modern` | AeroGrid's dark instrument palette. |
| `edgetx` | Colors based on the radio's active theme. |
| `custom` | The modern palette with overrides for `canvas`, `surface`, `text`, and `accent`. |

## Troubleshoot a reading

Check the panel's source name and expected data type first. A cells-table
source and a numeric pack-voltage source are not interchangeable. Check receiver
connection, sensor discovery, GPS fix, and model timer configuration as applicable.

Use `host` to inspect the loaded layout, panel loading, and service failures.
Interpret missing or stale states using the panel's reference page rather than
treating them as zero. If a copied fix is not taking effect, follow the
[upgrade instructions](installation.md#upgrade).
